## About

Finish your tasks during the day in a fun way earning stars.  
This is my individual school project at Hyper Island. A 8 weeks long developing process.

### Demo

TBA

### Goals & Reflection

I want to focus on and improve my Javascript and React skills. I choosed an old project that I want to develop further. It was my very first Javascript [project](https://github.com/elinamren/goodmorning). Now I want to add more functionality and options for the player.

### Challenges

Its hard to figure out a good visual settings page for the best UX.
I started to look at firebase but took a decition to wait, since I want to focus on JS and React firebase is not prioritized. I will keep it in my nice to have list if I got time futher ahead.

### Tools used
